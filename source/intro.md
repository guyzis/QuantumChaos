This project contains samples of the code used to write the following articles:


* Guy Zisling, Lea F. Santos, and Yevgeny Bar Lev, **How many particles make up a chaotic many-body quantum system?** `SciPost Phys. 10, 88 (2021) <https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.10.4.088>`_.
* Guy Zisling, Dante M. Kennes, and Yevegeny Bar Lev, **Transport in Stark Many Body Localized Systems** `arXiv:2109.06196 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06196>`_.


**The code can be used for two main purposes:**


1. Build Hamiltonian's (matrix representations) of spin-chain systems (mainly "XXZ" chain).
2. Examine the statical and dynamical properties of those Hamiltonian's.
